//! Tests for the line-pairing algorithm itself (dst→src mapping and moved
//! detection), independent of rendering.
//!
//! Principle under test: a destination line pairs with a source line only
//! when the AST mapping links them (mapped tokens vote) or when identical
//! text aligns inside the gap between two mapping-backed anchors.  Pairs
//! must never be invented from text similarity or leftover bookkeeping,
//! because invented pairs masquerade as moved or changed lines.
